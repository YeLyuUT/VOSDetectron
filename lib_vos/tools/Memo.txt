train_coco_static:
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
ability: proposal+cls+mask

# Filtering objects by rejecting proposals.
train_davis_static(for reference):
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses. Use global ID(id only, no background) to get feature generator.
ability: proposal+cls+mask+id(static id difference across all images. Mimic ReID.)
(optional)add proposals from file, which do not have cls,id,mask training.
Goal: high proposal recall and id identification ability.

train_davis_dynamic:
[f]:with flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses. Use local ID(id+background), online ID mapper. 
ability: proposal+cls+mask+id(dynamic proposal,cls,mask,id propagation,id differences in every frame.)
no-flip
Goal: id, cls and mask propogation.

offline_davis_test_training(all test sequence first frame):
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses.(static id difference)
no proposal training.
Goal: 

online_davis_test_training:
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses.(static id difference)
For the first frame, finetune rpn, bbox, id, cls and mask only.
For the rest frame, finetune rpn only, base on bbox and mask selected by id.
