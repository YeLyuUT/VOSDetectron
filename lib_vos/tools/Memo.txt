train_coco_static:
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
ability: proposal+cls+mask

train_davis_static(for reference):
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses. Use global ID(id only, no background) to get feature generator.
ability: proposal+cls+mask+id(static id difference across all images. Mimic ReID.)
add proposals from file.
add proposals, no class training.

train_davis_dynamic:
[f]:with flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses. Use local ID(id+background), online ID mapper. 
ability: proposal+cls+mask+id(dynamic proposal,cls,mask,id propagation,id differences in every frame.)
no-flip
no proposal training, only for better mask and identity.

offline_davis_test_training(all test sequence first frame):
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses.(static id difference)

online_davis_test_training:
[-f]:no flow and flow align module.
[pp]:losses for positive proposals only. Need high recall.
[id]:add identity branch and losses.(static id difference)
